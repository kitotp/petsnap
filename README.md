## About project

an experiment project built to practice state management in React (React Query + Redux) as well as backend development with FastAPI for integrating ML models. The main purpose was to test embedding an ML model into a full‑stack application.

A bit of background: this is a prototype of a social network with an admin panel where you can create posts, like them, delete them, etc. Thanks to the integrated CNN model, you don’t have to worry about post categories—the AI will automatically assign one (at the moment only two categories are supported: “cat” and “dog” :) ). Just for fun, I also built an admin interface where you can remove users and all their posts. don't worry, every endpoint is secured with protected routes.
